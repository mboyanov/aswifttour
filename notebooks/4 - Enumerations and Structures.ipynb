In the example above, `Ace` is explicitly given a raw value of `1`, and the rest of the raw values are assigned in order. You can also use strings or floating-point numbers as the raw type of an enumeration. Use the `rawValue` property to access the raw value of an enumeration case.\n\n Use the `init?(rawValue:)` initializer to make an instance of an enumeration from a raw value.

Inside the switch, the enumeration case is referred to by the abbreviated form `.hearts` because the value of `self` is already known to be a suit. You can use the abbreviated form anytime the value’s type is already known.\n\n If an enumeration has raw values, those values are determined as part of the declaration, which means every instance of a particular enumeration case always has the same raw value. Another choice for enumeration cases is to have values associated with the case—these values are determined when you make the instance, and they can be different for each instance of an enumeration case. You can think of the associated values as behaving like stored properties of the enumeration case instance. For example, consider the case of requesting the sunrise and sunset times from a server. The server either responds with the requested information, or it responds with a description of what went wrong.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"execution_count":0,"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"enum ServerResponse {\n    case result(String, String)\n    case failure(String)\n}\nlet success = ServerResponse.result(\"6:00 am\", \"8:09 pm\")\nlet failure = ServerResponse.failure(\"Out of cheese.\")\nswitch success {\n    case let .result(sunrise, sunset):\n        print(\"Sunrise is at \\(sunrise) and sunset is at \\(sunset).\")\n    case let .failure(message):\n        print(\"Failure...  \\(message)\")\n}\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":" - Experiment:\n Add a third case to `ServerResponse` and to the switch.\n\n Notice how the sunrise and sunset times are extracted from the `ServerResponse` value as part of matching the value against the switch cases.\n\n Use `struct` to create a structure. Structures support many of the same behaviors as classes, including methods and initializers. One of the most important differences between structures and classes is that structures are always copied when they are passed around in your code, but classes are passed by reference.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"execution_count":0,"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"struct Card {\n    var rank: Rank\n    var suit: Suit\n    func simpleDescription() -> String {\n        return \"The \\(rank.simpleDescription()) of \\(suit.simpleDescription())\"\n    }\n}\nlet threeOfSpades = Card(rank: .three, suit: .spades)\nlet threeOfSpadesDescription = threeOfSpades.simpleDescription()\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":" - Experiment:\n Write a function that returns an array containing a full deck of cards, with one card of each combination of rank and suit.\n\n [Previous](@previous) | [Next](@next)\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"swift","name":"swift","display_name":"Swift"},"language_info":{"mimetype":"text\/x-swift","version":"","file_extension":".swift","name":"swift"}},"nbformat_minor":2,"nbformat":4}
