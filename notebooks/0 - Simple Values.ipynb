You don’t need to import a separate library for functionality like input\/output or string handling. Code written at global scope is used as the entry point for the program, so you don’t need a `main()` function. You also don’t need to write semicolons at the end of every statement.\n\n This tour gives you enough information to start writing code in Swift by showing you how to accomplish a variety of programming tasks. Don’t worry if you don’t understand something—everything introduced in this tour is explained in detail in the rest of this book.\n\n ## Simple Values\n\n Use `let` to make a constant and `var` to make a variable. The value of a constant doesn’t need to be known at compile time, but you must assign it a value exactly once. This means you can use constants to name a value that you determine once but use in many places.\n\n","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"var myVariable = 42\nmyVariable = 50\nlet myConstant = 42\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":0},{"metadata":{},"source":" A constant or variable must have the same type as the value you want to assign to it. However, you don’t always have to write the type explicitly. Providing a value when you create a constant or variable lets the compiler infer its type. In the example above, the compiler infers that `myVariable` is an integer because its initial value is an integer.\n\n If the initial value doesn’t provide enough information (or if there is no initial value), specify the type by writing it after the variable, separated by a colon.\n\n","cell_type":"markdown"},{"execution_count":0,"outputs":[],"source":"let implicitInteger = 70\nlet implicitDouble = 70.0\nlet explicitDouble: Double = 70\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":" - Experiment:\n Create a constant with an explicit type of `Float` and a value of `4`.\n\n Values are never implicitly converted to another type.
